I've had a directory on under my user folder called *Development* for ages.
Probably since I started coding. Somehow, for the very first time, I saw someone
using a *Developer* folder and, damnit, they got a pretty icon on their folder.

![Developer folder][1]

I've been getting robbed of a fancy icon for years because I described the folder's
action and not its author?! Lame. I'm pretty sure I could dig out that icon and
add it to my *Development* folder, but then I will have to update it is the OS
changes. *Developer* folder it is.
