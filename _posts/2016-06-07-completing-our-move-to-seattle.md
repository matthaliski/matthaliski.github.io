We started our move to Seattle from Salt Lake City in November of 2015 and are now days away from completing that journey as we move into our new-to-us house. The Seattle housing market is [insane][1] and we knew we were going to get killed. Moving here 10 years ago would have been a smarter idea.

We rented an apartment when we came out thinking it would take 6 months to a year to find a new home. It had been eight years since we'd done the apartment thing and it wasn't long before all the fond memories of living stacked on top of each other resurfaced. I couldn't yell at the TV anymore. We could only see in one direction because all the windows were on one side. We occasionally had to fight for parking spots. I stood at the kitchen bar to write code because I didn't want to assemble an office and break it all down again in such a short amount of time.

I'm glad we'll be leaving most of that behind us. I also don't focus well on more than one thing at a time, so getting moved in and settled will allow me to focus more on coding projects when I'm not chasing the kiddo around.

I know "home is where you make it", but it's just a little more enjoyable when it's yours and you don't have to listen to the person next door take a poop.
