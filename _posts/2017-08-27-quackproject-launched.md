I've spent the last couple of months writing code in anticipation for football season on something I'm calling [Quack Project](https://quackproject.com).

## Quack Project is an Oregon Ducks fan site

I want fans to visit Quack Project to stay current on the latest Oregon Ducks sports news and share their thoughts on their favorite teams, players and events. I'll be spending considerable time during this upcoming football season tweaking the front page algorithm to allow users of the website to decide what news is most important. The goal is to create a thriving online Duck community where we can all share our passion for the Oregon Ducks.

This website is brand new, which means there will be the occasional bug that crops up. I'll be doing my best to take care of those as they appear and appreciate your patience. I welcome any and all suggestions for website improvements or features you think would be useful to other users. This truly is a *project* for me and any help is truly appreciated.

I've got lots to do, so that's it for this post. If you're a Duck fan, be sure to [check it out](https://quackproject.com).
