In 2008 I left the "land of plaid" and moved from Portland, OR to Salt Lake City, UT. My girlfriend, now wife, worked on her PhD and I spent the first winter skiing. We moved out in the summer when gas was hitting $5/gallon in some places, the economy was collapsing and then Senator Barack Obama was in the middle of his historic ascension the the Presidency of the United States.

I'd left a small boutique agency where I was the only "web guy." Not something I'd recommend early in your career. Having a mentor or peers to learn from is a good thing. I was a front-end designer/dev who just said "yes" to every project thrown my way. Because, why have focus when you're young and dumb? I even attempted to animate a TV spot in After Effects, which turned out horribly and I had to crash and burn in front of the client while fidgeting in our conference room. I shouldn't have said I could do it, but I liked to animate. I liked solving spatial problems and making things move. As a web guy I was fortunate that this was pre Steve Jobs' open letter (read: deathblow) to Adobe because there was this little thing called Flash that could satiate my desire to write code and make some really cool stuff.

## The Golden Age

Working at a tiny desk next to our bed in our 1-room apartment in Sugarhouse I sat down to teach myself ActionScript 3. 2008 may have been a shit year for the economy, but it was the Golden Age of Flash. ActionScript 3 had been out for a year and half and was maturing nicely. We could do so much more than `gotoAndPlay()`. We could OOP it up and create awesome interactive experiences. My prevailing thought was that I would become more focused on the world of Flash and hopefully make myself more hirable in the months to come.

In addition to burning through a couple AS3 books I had a little LCD TV tuned to election coverage. I figured I'd take advantage of having the freedom to watch how presidential campaigns operated as I built up a new skill set. To this day I'm not sure there was a better campaign to have watched than the 2008 Obama race. They changed how the game was played. It was fascinating watching his crowds grow and grow. They invested in big data to know who was where and what could turn them out to vote. Their campaign was better than my ActionScript. That I'm sure of.

I still find it to be a fascinating coincidence that at a time in my life when I was making a big directional change, the country was making an even bigger one.

## The middle part

The middle part of this story isn't all that important. I worked at a couple different advertising agencies. Did some cool stuff with banner ads that, I have no doubt, contributed to the rise of ad blockers.

We skied in the winters, rode motorcycles through the canyons in the summer, got a dog, got married and had a kid. Fairly productive by most accounts, but let's time-travel through those eight years to the present.

## What's old is new again

It's election season again! Déjà vu has struck and I find myself at a computer learning a new language, making another shift in career direction and watching Donald Trump set his hair (or whatever is on his head) on fire. I find the situational similarities eerie.

We moved to a new state. I'm freelancing while watching an election. The Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, will become the first woman President just as Barack Obama was the first African American to serve in the Oval Office. The Republican nominee is still an old ~~orange~~ white guy. And I'm choosing to focus, yet again, on a new language, Swift, that will allow me to relive some of those glory days of Flash.

Once Steve Jobs made it known that Flash had no place in Apple's walled garden the landscape began to change. The big brands still knocked out expensive Flash microsites for a couple years, but the necessity to be on mobile meant returning to a text editor and writing good old HTML/JS/CSS. So, I did.

I don't code next to our bed anymore. I have an office now with a standing desk. I don't fire up Flash anymore either. I'm pretty sure I've never opened up Adobe Animate CC. The last line of ActionScript I wrote was years ago. But, I find the Xcode and Swift experience to be nostalgic. It reminds me of Flash with all the panels and editor in one IDEish thing. It makes me happy.

I don't know how many of these eight-year cycles I have left in me. But, I suppose if I were to ask myself if I am better off than I was eight years ago I would have to say, "yes." *Thanks Obama*.
