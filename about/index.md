## Introduction

Hello there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Matt Haliski and I build things on computers. I've spent most of my professional career designing and programming websites while working at various advertising agencies. I'm now part dad, part indie game developer. The transition to game development is relatively new to me, but I'm having a lot of fun exploring this new world.

## Origin story

I started building websites in college at the University of Oregon. I still remember the day when I inserted some text inside the `<title>` tags and saw it subsequently appear at the top of a browser window. That small act might as well have been magic. It's important to note that first steps are never trivial, however basic they may be. I had *coded* something and that code became something real. I was probably a year away from knowing that an `array` was, but it didn't matter. My first steps into this new world were profound and lasting.

For the next decade I wore a ton of different hats as I built website after website. During that time I struggled with what to consider myself. Was I a web designer? Maybe I was more of a frontend developer. SQL sort of scared me, so I was pretty sure I wasn't a backend developer. Should my career have been focused on a specialty or would I have made myself more valuable by being multi-disciplined? Those are tough questions to answer when you're young, as they can have profound impacts on your career. 

In the end, the river took me where it wanted to. I probably said "yes" to too many things. I backed myself into a corner by overpromising far too many times to count. I worked with a lot of cool people who leant me their knowledge and also showed me how far I had to go. I piled on brick after brick until I was finally able to step back and be proud of what I'd built. I went from a self-taught html tinkerer to a Senior Front-End Developer and things were good.

And so, since I'd been in the habit of figuring things out after I'd committed to them, I decided to take the next step. I decided I was ready to strike out on my own.

## Stay Wild Games

My initial foray into the land of independence continued with building websites. I built a couple college football news aggregator websites that combined my development skills and love for college sports. These endeavors coincided with the birth of our daughter which, in hindsight, should not have been something attempted in concert. As it turns out, infants don't just sit there and cheer you on as you hammer away at the keyboard. 

So my web stuff slowed down as priorities shifted. In the middle of all this we made a big move from Salt Lake City back to the Pacific Northwest. After finally finding a house in the *insane* Seattle housing market, I set up my workspace again and started doing some thinking about the current state of the internet. A lot had changed since writing code in a dorm room as a college freshman. It wasn't the Wild West anymore. The internet had grown up and matured. The barrier to entry had gown exponentially and people were playing for high stakes. Successful sites weren't basement operations anymore.

With these considerations, a daughter to look after, and a wider perspective, I found myself searching for the right fit. I needed something to pursue that challenged both sides of my brain while being something I could drop for a couple days if I needed to. Websites are living and breathing things, after all. If they break, come under load, or are attacked, then youâ€™re immediately responsible for fixes. That kind of sucks and wasn't something I felt I could commit to so I began to explore other arenas.

That brought me to Unity. Unity, for those unaware, is a powerful game engine that helps ease the burden of game development. As I kicked the tires I had flashbacks to when I used to build projects for Flash in ActionScript 3. I was excited that so many of the tools I used to manually construct we're *just there* in Unity. The flow of the application felt comfortable and something I hope to master one day. The development cycle when building a game also appealed to me. Basically you bury yourself in a hole for a year or two and then come up for air and hope people like what you made. This particular life choice, I understand, is not for everyone, but it works for me. And so it began.

[Stay Wild Games](https://staywildgames.com), my independent game company, was born.

## Other stuff

When I'm not in front of a computer I do have somewhat of a life. My wife and I love to ski. I enjoy riding motorcycles. Both of these activities seem more and more infrequent as we spend our time hanging out with our daughter. She's worth it. I love the Pacific Northwest. I dig the vibe. The trees, the *gray,* the ocean and the mountains are all why I like to call this part of the country home.

I play video games on the PS4 and my iPhone which, depending on who you talk to, means I'm not a *real* gamer. I think Hideo Kojima is a legend. I think the stuff Naughty Dog puts out is stupid good. My earliest video game memory is some vague Atari stuff, but the original Sega Genesis is really where it all started. My parents didn't let my brother and I have video games consoles, but occasionally we'd get to rent a Sega for the weekend from the movie rental place. Altered Beast anyone?!

I'm pretty much Apple everything for both work and play. I actually started on PCs, but nearly the entire design world was running Macs when I got into it all, so I switched and never looked back.

Anywhoo, congrats if you made it this far. I'll shut up now. I should probably be writing some `C#` rather than goofing around on my personal blog. I'll try to use this site to help others out on their journey. Head over to the [blog](/) for that. Thanks for stopping by.

Stay wild, my friends.
