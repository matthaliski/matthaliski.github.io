As I get older and find myself constantly balancing life and work, I've really come to appreciate the people and products that make my life easier. As programmers we live in a unique world where our peers build fantastic products and then give them away. I've leveraged far more than I could possibly give back, so a simple *thank you* page for those doing yeoman's work is the least I could do.

These are in no particular order and I'm not affiliated with any of these open source or paid projects. They're just great!

### [Ruby on Rails <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i></sup>](https://rubyonrails.org/){:class="text-decoration-none" }

Some things just just make sense to your brain and Ruby on Rails is no exception. Thanks to [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh/) and all the other devs who've contributed to that repo. I adore the project's philosophy and am constantly amazed by its constant, stable march forward. Starting a project in Rails today is just as viable as it was when it was the new kid on the block.

### [Ruby <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i></sup>](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:class="text-decoration-none" }

Ruby is, by far, my favorite language. It's an absolute joy to program in. I greatly appreciate the clear attempts the language makes to improve my experience as a writer of code. I *love* the lonely operator: `&.` You must watch [Matz's explanation for that one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE0g2TUsJ4U#t=16m36s). I have basically mandated that I will always have one Rails project live so that, even though I'm creating games now, I will always have a reason to come back and touch Ruby every once in a while. 

### [Bootstrap <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i></sup>](https://getbootstrap.com/){:class="text-decoration-none" }

I've followed [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [@fat](https://twitter.com/fat) since the early days of Bootstrap. The Bootstrap framework is just a hell of a project. I have no idea how many websites it's been incorporated into, but the number must be staggering. I've used it for years and years and it's the first thing that goes in when starting a new project. I'd be dead without it. Also, the documentation is almost as good as the framework itself.

### [Cook Smarts <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i></sup>](https://www.cooksmarts.com/){:class="text-decoration-none" }

This has little to do with my actual work, but it's no less important. There are a lot of meal plan startups out there, but Cook Smarts fits our family the best. If you want to eat well and enjoy cooking while not being bothered with meal planning and grocery lists, then Cook Smarts is perfect for you. It's also budget-friendly. 

It's also insane to me that, as I understand it, they've done all the leg work on their website themselves. Like, they just whipped out the web stuff on the side while they ran their core business. They make me feel lazy. Keep it going over there Jess and company!  

### [Michael Hartl and Rails Tutorial <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i></sup>](https://www.railstutorial.org/){:class="text-decoration-none" }

We all have to start somewhere and for many people learning Rails it's Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial. Learning Rails was a big step for me. At that time I was mostly cutting things up in Photoshop and writing CSS and HTML. Any backend work was passed off to colleagues who wrote PHP. I was interested in a framework like Rails because I needed the structure it provided. Hartl's tutorial walked me through all of that structure in a clear and detailed manner. I finally feel like I'm *okay* when it comes to Ruby on Rails and a ton of credit goes to Hartl. 

### [Lee Brimelow <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i></sup>](https://twitter.com/leebrimelow){:class="text-decoration-none" }

Oh, man. Remember gotoandlearn.com?! ActionScript 3 is still probably my most comfortable language behind Ruby, HTML and CSS. I learned all about object-oriented programming thanks to helpful people like Lee. I also always thought he had a cool job with Adobe. He got to espouse the virtues of Flash and, I will get flamed for saying this, *Flash was great*. Steve Jobs may have signed Flash's death warrant, but there was no greater creative period on the web. People like Lee helped us all learn and create cool stuff.

### [Aaron Patterson aka @tenderlove <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link fa-xs"></i></sup>](https://twitter.com/tenderlove){:class="text-decoration-none" }

Aaron.

I'm pretty sure Aaron only lives a couple miles from me and I hope I bump into him someday. I am glad we Rubyists have him as a core contributor because he's great. Follow him on Twitter for corny jokes and flat-faced cats. He also created [Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/), which I used extensively for years without ever even knowing he was the creator. I found out by listening to some random podcast someday.

Forget learning the applications, learn the fundamentals.
